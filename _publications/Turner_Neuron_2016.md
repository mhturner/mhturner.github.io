abstract: 'A central goal in the study of any sensory system is
to predict neural responses to complex inputs, especially those encountered during natural stimulation.
Nowhere is the transformation from stimulus to
response better understood than the vertebrate
retina. Nevertheless, descriptions of retinal computation are largely based on stimulation using artificial
visual stimuli, and it is unclear how these descriptions map onto the encoding of natural stimuli. We
demonstrate that nonlinear spatial integration, a
common feature of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) processing, shapes neural responses to natural visual
stimuli in primate Off parasol RGCs, whereas On
parasol RGCs exhibit surprisingly linear spatial integration. Despite this asymmetry, both cell types
show strong nonlinear integration when presented
with artificial stimuli. We show that nonlinear integration of natural stimuli is a consequence of rectified
excitatory synaptic input and that accounting for
nonlinear spatial integration substantially improves
models that predict RGC responses to natural
images.'
