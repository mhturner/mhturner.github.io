abstract: 'Synaptic inhibition controls a neuron’s output via functionally distinct inputs at two subcellular compartments, the cell body and the dendrites. It is unclear whether the assembly of these distinct inhibitory inputs can be regulated independently by neurotransmission. In the mammalian retina, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release from starburst amacrine cells (SACs) onto the dendrites of on–off direction-selective ganglion cells (ooDSGCs) is essential for directionally selective responses. We found that ooDSGCs also receive GABAergic input on their somata from other amacrine cells (ACs), including ACs containing the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). When net GABAergic transmission is reduced, somatic, but not dendritic, GABAA receptor clusters on the ooDSGC increased in number and size. Correlative fluorescence imaging and serial electron microscopy revealed that these enlarged somatic receptor clusters are localized to synapses. By contrast, selectively blocking vesicular GABA release from either SACs or VIP ACs did not alter dendritic or somatic receptor distributions on the ooDSGCs, showing that neither SAC nor VIP AC GABA release alone is required for the development of inhibitory synapses in ooDSGCs. Furthermore, a reduction in net GABAergic transmission, but not a selective reduction from SACs, increased excitatory drive onto ooDSGCs. This increased excitation may drive a homeostatic increase in ooDSGC somatic GABAA receptors. Differential regulation of GABAA receptors on the ooDSGC’s soma and dendrites could facilitate homeostatic control of the ooDSGC’s output while enabling the assembly of the GABAergic connectivity underlying direction selectivity to be indifferent to altered transmission.'
