Neural responses are noisy, and circuit structure
can correlate this noise across neurons. Theoretical
studies show that noise correlations can have
diverse effects on population coding, but these
studies rarely explore stimulus dependence of noise
correlations. Here, we show that noise correlations in
responses of ON-OFF direction-selective retinal gan-
glion cells are strongly stimulus dependent, and we
uncover the circuit mechanisms producing this stim-
ulus dependence. A population model based on
these mechanistic studies shows that stimulus-
dependent noise correlations improve the encoding
of motion direction 2-fold compared to independent
noise. This work demonstrates a mechanism by
which a neural circuit effectively shapes its signal
and noise in concert, minimizing corruption of signal
by noise. Finally, we generalize our findings beyond
direction coding in the retina and show that stim-
ulus-dependent correlations will generally enhance
information coding in populations of diversely tuned
neurons.
