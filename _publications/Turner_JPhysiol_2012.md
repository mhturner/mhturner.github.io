abstract: 'The production and flow of cerebrospinal fluid performs an important role in the
development and homeostasis of the central nervous system. However, these processes are difficult
to study in the mammalian brain because the ventricles are situated deep within the parenchyma.
In this communication we introduce the zebrafish larva as an in vivo model for studying cerebral
ventricle and blood–brain barrier function. Using confocal microscopy we show that zebrafish
ventricles are topologically similar to those of the mammalian brain. We describe a new method
for measuring the dynamics of molecular transport within the ventricles of live zebrafish by
means of the uncaging of a fluorescein derivative. Furthermore, we determine that in 5–6 days
post-fertilization zebrafish, the dispersal of molecules in the ventricles is driven by a combination
of ciliary motion and diffusion. The zebrafish presents a tractable system with the advantage of
genetics, size and transparency for exploring ventricular physiology and for mounting large-scale
high throughput experiments.'
