abstract: 'Antagonistic receptive field surrounds are a near-universal property of early sensory
processing. A key assumption in many models for retinal ganglion cell encoding is that receptive
field surrounds are added only to the fully formed center signal. But anatomical and functional
observations indicate that surrounds are added before the summation of signals across receptive
field subunits that creates the center. Here, we show that this receptive field architecture has an
important consequence for spatial contrast encoding in the macaque monkey retina: the surround
can control sensitivity to fine spatial structure by changing the way the center integrates visual
information over space. The impact of the surround is particularly prominent when center and
surround signals are correlated, as they are in natural stimuli. This effect of the surround differs
substantially from classic center-surround models and raises the possibility that the surround plays
unappreciated roles in shaping ganglion cell sensitivity to natural inputs.'
