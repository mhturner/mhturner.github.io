I'm a computational and systems neuroscientist interested in the neural circuits that underlie visual computation and coding.
I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow in <a href="https://flyvisionlab.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Tom Clandinin's lab</a> at Stanford University.
I got my PhD in the Neuroscience graduate program at the University of Washington. I did my dissertation work in <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/riekelab/" target="_blank">Fred Rieke's lab</a>.
